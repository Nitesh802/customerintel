[INFO] Perplexity retry #2 - HTTP: 200, errno: 0, error: None, elapsed: 1247ms
[INFO] Perplexity API succeeded after 2 retries
[INFO] NB execution completed successfully with enhanced retry logic


2. NB EXECUTION - PLACEHOLDER CREATION
======================================
[INFO] Starting NB execution for NB10
[INFO] Exception on attempt 1: API rate limit exceeded
[INFO] Exception on attempt 2: Network timeout
[INFO] Exception on attempt 3: JSON validation failed
[INFO] Creating placeholder result: NB execution failed with exception: JSON validation failed
[INFO] Placeholder result created for NB10 with fallback risk assessment data
[INFO] NB execution completed with placeholder - pipeline continues


3. SYNTHESIS ENGINE - GRACEFUL HANDLING
=======================================
[INFO] Synthesis starting with 13 NBs available, 2 placeholder NBs detected
[INFO] Processing NB1 (Financial) - placeholder detected, using fallback: 'Financial performance optimization (data unavailable)'
[INFO] Processing NB3 (Operational) - data available, extracting operational issues
[INFO] Processing NB4 (Competitive) - data available, extracting competitive threats
[INFO] Processing NB10 (Risk) - placeholder detected, using fallback: 'Risk management framework (data unavailable)'
[INFO] Executive Insight generation completed with graceful fallback integration
[INFO] All sections drafted successfully with placeholder-aware processing


4. FINAL REPORT - APPENDIX NOTES
=================================
[INFO] Collecting placeholder NB information for appendix
[INFO] Found 2 placeholder NBs: NB1, NB10
[INFO] Adding appendix note: 'Data Processing Notes'
[INFO] Appendix content: 'The following analysis modules encountered processing issues and used fallback data: NB1, NB10. This may affect the depth of insights in certain sections but does not compromise the overall strategic recommendations.'
[INFO] Final report bundle prepared with transparency notes
[INFO] Synthesis completed successfully with full transparency
